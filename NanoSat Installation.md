This project contains the following:

The whitepaper describing the NanoSat algorithm, called PvsNP.pdf
NanoSat source as NanoSat.zip
Different sizes formulae (around 47000) as .zip folders
Two of the most well known and used 3-SAT engines in the Othe 3-SAT Engines.zip file

Note: 
all the size 100 files used as benchmark are split into 5 .zip since the entire suite was way too big even as a .zip
if you want to try them all sequentially, merge all .cnf file into one folder, together with NanoSat.exe

Nanosat installation

For the purpose of the document we will presume windows install

go to c:
git glone current verion
"extract here" NanoSat.zip
test installation
cmd C:\nanosat\NanoSat\bin\Debug
NanoSat.exe
 - you should receive an error. it's fine:) 
    No formula input file was selected!
all tests are grouped by name

 Ex1: 
      1. extract 20.zip
      2. copy C:\nanosat\NanoSat\bin\Debug\NanoSat.exe to C:\nanosat\20
      3. run NanaoSat all
 Ex2:
      1. Extract UF125.538.100_size_125_all_sat.zip
      2. copy C:\nanosat\NanoSat\bin\Debug\NanoSat.exe to C:\nanosat\UF125.538.100_size_125_all_sat
      3. run NanaoSat all
